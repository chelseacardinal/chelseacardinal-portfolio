description: Cover for a collection of "devastating and hopeful" essays by Michael
  Paterniti. In thinking of a way to embody the title, flowers came immediately to
  mind for their traditional presence in both love and death. As most of these essays
  are really quite sad, I drew the flowers wilted.
