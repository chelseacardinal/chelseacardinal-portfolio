title: Congratulations by the Way
color: "#FBFAF8"
description: Three months after George Saunders gave a graduation address at Syracuse
  University in 2013, a transcript of that speech was posted on the website of <em>The
  New York Times</em>, where its simple, uplifting message struck a deep chord. This
  short book contains the text of that address accompanied on the left hand pages
  by a "flip-book" animation of exploding stars.
